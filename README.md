Purpose of a Landing Page
A landing page serves as the initial point of contact for visitors to a website. Its primary goal is to capture the visitor's attention, provide concise and appealing information about a product, service, or company, and encourage them to take specific actions, such as signing up, making a purchase, or exploring further.

For your project, the landing page represents CodSoft’s identity and objectives. It should effectively communicate the company's mission, services, and values while maintaining a visually appealing design that engages users.
